A)
Select name 
From Customer
Where referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS  NULL 
Order BY id

Wrong:)
Select name 
From Customer
Where id != 2 OR id = null    (Null is unknown )   Correct way to check NULL      -> IS NULL   or    -> IS NOT NULL
Order BY id


Find the names of the customer that are either:
referred by any customer with id != 2. 
not referred by any customer.
Return the result table in any order.

When the problem says
referred by customer with id != 2
That translates directly to:
referee_id != 2
Not:
id != 2
